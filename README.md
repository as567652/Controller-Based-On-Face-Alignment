## Introduction
Aim of this code snippet is to make a simple computer vison project, which can be used in different applications.This can be used to control games and by using **PyAutoGUI** you can control mouse also.
Just for FUN.


## Technologies
  #### Software Used :
  * VS Code : 1.58.2
  #### Languages Used :
  * Python 3
  #### Libraries Used :
  * OpenCV
  * PyAutoGUI
  #### Project Tested On :
   * Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS 64-bit


## Setup
First you must have these softwares and languages installed on your system -
  * [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
  * [OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)](https://opencv.org/releases/)
  * [PyAutoGUI](https://pypi.org/project/PyAutoGUI/#files)


## Instructions Before Launch
These instructions must be followed to get better results :-
  * Face should be in better lit area.
  * Control works only on current focussed window only (You can easily edit this part)


## Launch
